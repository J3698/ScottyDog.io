We wanted to create an ".io" type game that involves multiple players and a leaderboard to keep rank. As we were brainstorming ideas for our game, we were reflecting on our few weeks spent here at CMU and the week of tests ahead.

We thought the best way to convey a message would be through a mix of comedy and a simple yet addicting game mechanic that can draw people in.
